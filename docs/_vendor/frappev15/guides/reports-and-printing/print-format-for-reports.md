In version 4.1 we introduce Report Print Formats. These are HTML templates that you can use to format Query Report data for printing.

### 1. Creating New Print Formats

To create a new Print Format, just drop in a `.html` file in the folder of the query report. For example, for the [General Ledger](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/tree/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/general_ledger) report in ERPNext, you can drop in a file called `general_ledger.html` along side the `.js` and `.py` files.

##### Tree Of `erpnext/accounts/general_ledger`

general\_ledger/
├── \_\_init\_\_.py
├── general\_ledger.html
├── general\_ledger.js
├── general\_ledger.json
└── general\_ledger.py

### 2. Templating

For templating, we use an adapted version of [John Resig's microtemplating script](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/). If you know Javascript, it is very easy to follow this templating language.

##### Here are some examples (from John Resig's Blog):

Example: Properities:

">

**<%=from\\_user%>:** <%=text%>

Example: Code structures, Loops

<% for ( var i = 0; i < users.length; i++ ) { %>
- <%=users[i].name%>

<% } %>

> **Note**: It is important to note that you should not use single quotes (') in your template as the engine cannot handle them effectively.

### 3. Data

Data is available to the template as:

* `data`: this is a list of records, with each record as an object with slugified properties from labels. For example "Posting Date" becomes "posting\_date"
* `filters`: filters set in the report
* `report`: reportview object

### 4. Example

Here is how the General Ledger Report is built:

[General Ledger Print Format Template](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/general_ledger/general_ledger.html)

Here is what the report looks like:

1. [Bootstrap Stylesheet](http://getbootstrap.com) is pre-loaded.
2. You can use all global functions like `fmt_money` and dateutil.
3. Translatable strings should be written as `__("text")`
4. You can create modules and import using `{% include "templates/includes/formats/common_format" %}`
