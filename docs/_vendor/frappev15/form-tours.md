Frappe provides an easy way to generate form tutorials for your complex doctype with very little configuration.

## Creating a Form Tour

To create a Form Tour, type "new form tour" in awesomebar and hit enter.

1. Enter Title. For eg., 'Creating a Custom Field'
2. Select Reference DocType.
3. Add steps defining each fields.
4. Save the document.

*A Tour to explain creation of Custom Fields*

## Configuration Options

### Form Tour

1. **Is Standard**: To make a standard Form Tour which will be stored as JSON. Can only be set while developer mode is on.
2. **Save on Completion**: If checked, the last step of the Form Tour will prompt the user to save the document.
3. **Show First Document Tour**: If you want to show the tour of an existing document instead of a new form, enable this. As the name suggests, it gives the tour of the very first document created for this DocType.
4. **Include Name Field**: For some doctypes, the name is set by the user. On enabling this, the name field becomes the first step of the tour.

### Form Tour Steps

1. **Field**: A field from the selected doctype. This will be highlighted with a Title & Description.
2. **Title** & **Description**: To describe the field for its use, impact, and other hidden wirings of the field.
3. **Position**: The position of the highlighting popover is decided by this field. There are multiple options to choose depending upon the position of the highlighted field.
4. **Next Condition**: A code field which expects a valid JS condition which applies on the document. For eg., for a Task DocType Tour, we can check if task priority is set before going to the next condition by setting next condition as follows:

   `eval: doc.priority != ""`
5. **Is Table Field**: To be checked if the field to be highlighted is under a child table.
6. **Parent Field**: Table field from the selected doctype. Only visible if **Is Table Field** is checked. Allows user to select a child table field.

## Triggering the Tours

Once you are done describing the Form & its fields, you are now ready to trigger the tour by using Form API. You just have to initialize the tour with appropriate `tour_name` and then simply start the tour with `frm.tour.start()`.

```
frappe.ui.form.on('Custom Field', 'onload', () => {
 const tour_name = 'Creating a Custom Field';
 frm.tour
 .init({ tour_name })
 .then(() => frm.tour.start());
});
```
