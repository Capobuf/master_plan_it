Welcome to Frappe Framework Documentation

Frappe, pronounced *fra-pay*, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com), is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

## Getting Started

### Why Frappe?

The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that **meta-data** is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.
