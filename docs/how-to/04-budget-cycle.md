# How to run the annual budget cycle

## Draft
- Create a `MPIT Budget` for the target year.
- Populate budget lines from validated baseline, contracts and new proposals.

## Review
- Usa le transizioni workflow: Draft → Proposed → In Review → Approved.

## Approve
- Client Editor and vCIO Manager can approve.
- Approval submits the document and freezes it (immutable baseline).

## After approval
- Post-approval changes are handled via the Forecast refresh (V2 model) and variance/exception entries, not amendments.
- Record exceptions/allowance spends continuously.
